# H5 Game Collection

This is a collection of open-source H5 games from GitHub that can be deployed to personal domains. As a student who understands the need for accessible educational games, I've compiled these games to help fellow students who are looking for unblocked gaming options. The deployment process takes about 5 minutes with straightforward steps, and you can create your own private game page with a custom domain. This approach ensures reliable access while maintaining privacy, making it suitable for educational environments.

# H5 Game Collection

As a student who understands the frustration of having gaming websites blocked, I've created this collection to help fellow students who are looking for unblocked gaming options. This is a collection of open-source H5 games from GitHub that can be deployed to personal domains. With one-click deployment, you can create your own private game page with a custom domain. This approach ensures reliable access while maintaining privacy, making it suitable for educational environments.

## Features

- üéÆ Curated high-quality H5 games
- üöÄ One-click deployment
- üîí Enhanced privacy with personal domain
- üì± Mobile-friendly
- üÜì Completely free to use

## Deployment Options

### Quick Access (Recommended for Beginners)
If you're new to programming or prefer a simpler approach, you can visit the [pre-built game collection](https://edgeone.ai/pages/games-unblocked?source=tomchild). This page provides two options:
- Direct access to already deployed games
- One-click deployment buttons for instant access

This is the easiest way to get started without any technical knowledge!

### Self-Deployment (For Learning)
If you want to learn how to deploy games yourself and gain the ability to deploy other GitHub open-source games, follow the deployment guide below. This knowledge will enable you to deploy any GitHub game project in the future.

## Quick Start

### For Non-Programmers
If you're not familiar with programming or GitHub, you can follow this simple guide. This is the easiest way to deploy games - no programming knowledge required!

#### Step 1: Download the Game
1. Choose a game from the [Game List](#game-list) above
2. Click on the "Project" link to go to the game's GitHub page
3. Click the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP"
   ![Download ZIP](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/85/b1/d6/85b1d6a8f00c1844eaa29d91f5842ac2.jpg)

#### Step 2: Access Deployment Page
1. Visit [EdgeOne.ai Manage Page](https://edgeone.ai/pages/manage)
2. Click the "Upload" button
   ![Upload Button](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/22/4d/3c/224d3c758e357144830ce9400b9c527d.jpg)

#### Step 3: Upload and Deploy
1. Upload the ZIP file you downloaded in Step 1
2. Click "Start Deployment"
   ![Upload and Deploy](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/54/e9/f1/54e9f1f400d246f25f7bc693223f1892.jpg)

#### Step 4: Wait for Deployment
Just wait a moment while your game is being deployed
![Deployment Progress](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c9/69/5c/c9695c1b52a43a19a9764f05941b693a.jpg)

That's it! Once deployment is complete, you can play the game online. This is the simplest and fastest way to deploy GitHub games that I've ever seen!

### For Programmers
If you're familiar with programming and GitHub, you can use the advanced deployment method below. This method gives you more control and flexibility.

#### Understanding the Deployment URL
The deployment URL follows this structure: `https://edgeone.ai/pages/new?template=GITHUB_REPO_URL&source=tomchild`
- `template`: This parameter should be the GitHub repository URL of the game you want to deploy
- `source`: This is a tracking parameter (you can keep it as is)

This means you can deploy any GitHub game repository by replacing the `template` parameter with the repository URL. For example, if you find another open-source game on GitHub, you can deploy it using the same format.

Below is a detailed step-by-step tutorial with screenshots showing what happens after you click the "Deploy" button:

1. Choose your favorite game from the Game List above
2. Click the "Deploy" button in the Game List table above
3. If you are using Google Chrome and have a Google account, simply click "Sign in with Google" to log in with your Google email
   ![Login Screen](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/97/63/85/9763856f6911b11fc7cde045d1165d9f.jpg)
4. Next, you'll see a GitHub integration screen. If you already have a GitHub account, please log in to GitHub and click "github" to link it
   ![GitHub Integration](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/47/42/6d/47426de92aada699773055a6932cb564.jpg)
5. After clicking github, you'll see a GitHub integration interface - simply click "install" to proceed
   ![GitHub Install](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/31/88/fd/3188fdc18a30409bb235f5601054ab89.jpg)
6. After linking your GitHub account, you'll see a visibility settings screen. Here you can choose between "private" (only you can access the deployed game) or "public" (everyone can access the deployed game). Make your choice and click the "create" button to start the deployment
   ![Visibility Settings](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/8f/e0/5f/8fe05f148dc399f32727e30facfd914e.jpg)
7. After clicking "create", you'll see a deployment waiting screen - just wait for the deployment to complete
   ![Deployment Waiting](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/5c/8e/0a/5c8e0a44ad6f5195655718dd46cb40b4.jpg)
8. Once deployment is complete, you'll see a congratulatory message. Click the link indicated by the arrow to start playing the game! The link will take you to your own unique custom domain, which is private to you. Since this is your personal domain, as long as you don't share it publicly, you can avoid any blocking risks.
    ![Deployment Complete](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/56/f1/c8/56f1c854a5f1623d2c901bc178109c73.jpg)
9. Now you can play the H5 game on your own domain!
